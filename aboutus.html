             <p> We provide services, resources and advocacy to foster growth in the business community and benefit BondCounty.  We believe a healthy community can only be maintained by a strong local economy.  The Greenville Chamber represents and works for our members, which include businesses and organizations not only located in Greenville but those located elsewhere and doing business in Greenville.</p>
             <p>We are a voice for each of our members and encourage participation by all. We are an excellent resource for anyone wanting information about Richmond and its business opportunities, policies and trends.</p>
             <p>Our primary goals are to strengthen our local economy, to promote the community, provide networking opportunities, represent the interest of business with government, and develop community leaders. Neither our mission, nor any of these goals can be met unless we partner with you to make our region’s future brighter. </p>
             <p><strong>Our Vision:</strong> To be the energetic heart of a strong, sustainable local economy.</p>
             <p><strong>Our Mission:</strong> We provide services that help all local businesses thrive.</p>

            <div class="text-justify">
              <p>In the United States, Chambers of Commerce are older than the Declaration of Independence.  The New York State Chamber, the first in America, was organized in 1768 and five years later the first local Chamber was formed in Charleston, South Carolina.  Today there are more than 4,000 Chambers of Commerce in the United States, all working to provide vital information, services and programming to business and civic organizations in their communities.</p>
              <p>There were a little over 100 members listed on the original roster. Today, The Chamber has close to 500 members made up of all sizes and types of businesses, non-profits and civic organizations as well as educational institutions, churches and individuals.  And while its name, programs and services have changed over the past years, the goals remain very similar to those laid out during our foundation.</p>
              <p>Our Chamber is dedicated to helping local companies grow their business by taking the lead in programs and efforts that help create a strong local economy and making our community a great place to do business. We provide many educational opportunities to help business improve.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>To be the voice of the Greenville business community and influential in policymaking at the local level.</li>
                <li>To provide a competitive edge for our members through economic and business development for our community.</li>
                <li>To be the town’s super-connector of businesses to customers, partnerships and opportunities.</li>
                <li>To be recognized by residents and visitors as a vibrant organization.</li>
              </ul>
